Titanic, for the Thematic Theme Framework
===============

Titanic is a child theme built on top of the Responsive Base for the Thematic Theme Framework. All the Titanic theme does is add some styling and changes the way the menu works. The menu is unique in that at smaller viewport sizes (such as mobile phones) the top menu collapses and instead has a jump link to a footer menu, which just is a different approach to handling menus with responsive web design.

It is intended to work best with the latest version of Thematic 1.0+, but works on 9.7.7 and above and also works perfectly with the new Thematic HTML5 Plugin which makes the code a little more modern.
